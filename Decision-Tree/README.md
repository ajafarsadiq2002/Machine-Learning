# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. It utilizes a decision tree classifier trained on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The model predicts survival based on inputs such as passenger class, sex, age, and fare.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   ```
2.Install the required packages:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
# Data

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3)
Sex: Passenger sex (male or female)
Age: Passenger age
Fare: Ticket fare
The target variable is:

Survived: Indicates if the passenger survived (1) or not (0)
# Model
The decision tree classifier is trained to predict the survival of passengers. The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy on the test set.
