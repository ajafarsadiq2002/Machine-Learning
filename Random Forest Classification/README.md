# Classification Model for Digit Recognition

## Overview
This project involves building a classification model to recognize handwritten digits using the popular MNIST digits dataset. It demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to preprocess data, train a classifier, and evaluate its performance.

## Contents
- Importing necessary libraries.
- Loading the digits dataset from Scikit-learn.
- Data visualization and preprocessing.
- Model training.
- Evaluation of the model.

## Installation
To run this notebook, you will need to install Python and the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```
